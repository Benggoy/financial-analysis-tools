## Performance Measurement Tools

### Return Calculations
- **Total Return:** (Ending Value - Beginning Value + Dividends) / Beginning Value
- **Annualized Return:** ((1 + Total Return) ^ (1/Years)) - 1
- **Risk-Adjusted Return:** Return per unit of risk (Sharpe ratio)

### Risk Metrics
- **Standard Deviation:** Measure of volatility
- **Maximum Drawdown:** Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Beta:** Sensitivity to market movements
- **Value at Risk (VaR):** Potential loss at given confidence level

### Benchmark Comparison
- **Relative Performance:** Portfolio vs relevant benchmarks
- **Alpha Generation:** Excess return above expected return
- **Information Ratio:** Active return per unit of tracking error

## Rebalancing Framework

### Rebalancing Triggers
1. **Time-Based:** Quarterly or semi-annual reviews
2. **Threshold-Based:** When allocation drifts 5%+ from target
3. **Opportunity-Based:** Market volatility creates opportunities

### Rebalancing Process
1. **Review Current Allocation**
   - Calculate actual percentages
   - Compare to target allocation
   - Identify significant drifts

2. **Determine Rebalancing Needs**
   - Which assets are overweight/underweight
   - Tax implications of selling positions
   - Transaction costs considerations

3. **Execute Rebalancing**
   - Sell overweight positions
   - Buy underweight positions
   - Use new contributions to rebalance when possible

### Tax-Efficient Rebalancing
- **Use tax-advantaged accounts** for frequent rebalancing
- **Harvest tax losses** when rebalancing taxable accounts
- **Consider asset location** (tax-efficient asset placement)
